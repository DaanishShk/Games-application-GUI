# Games_application-GUI-
This application was a group project for which I was responsible to connect the four python games made by my group members using the skills I learnt from my standalone desktop application. Only the GUI is included.

The UI of the application is written in python using the library tkinter that comes pre-installed with the latest version of python. The code required to implement menus, dialog boxes, buttons and widgets was added to the program by importing the respective classes from the tkinter library.

The size of the main window is kept locked to avoid any scaling issues. The top bar contains a drop down menu for developer and version info. Each of the 4 boxes contains a clickable button, a screenshot of the respective game and short description about the game. Clicking the button launches the game in a new window.

The clickable buttons will not work as only the UI is included in this repository.
